# agecalculator
This project is developed in python using Tkinter (GUI) and is a simple implementation of datetime module in order to find a person’s age at a given point of time. This doesn’t requires large chunk of data as it’s developed using limited number of modules and database and therefore enhances experience of its user without eating up resources.
